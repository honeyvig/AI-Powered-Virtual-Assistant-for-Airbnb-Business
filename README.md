=============
To build an AI-powered virtual assistant for managing operations like guest inquiries, automating review disputes, and integrating with your PMS (ResNexus or Hostaway), we can use Google Dialogflow CX for conversational AI and integrate it with Twilio and automation tools for seamless communication. Below is a Python code example to help with the automation, API integrations, and webhook setup.
Step 1: Setup and Requirements

You need to install a few libraries and tools:

    Dialogflow CX: For building and managing conversational flows.
    Twilio: For sending SMS and making phone calls.
    Requests: For webhook integrations.
    Flask: For setting up webhook endpoints.

First, install the necessary dependencies:

pip install twilio google-cloud-dialogflow requests Flask

Step 2: Setting Up Google Dialogflow CX

Before proceeding, you'll need to create a Dialogflow CX agent and configure intents, training phrases, and fulfillment logic. You can use the Google Cloud Console to create your Dialogflow CX agent.

Make sure you have the Dialogflow CX credentials in a service account key JSON file. You’ll also need to configure your environment to use this key.
Step 3: Python Code to Integrate Dialogflow CX, Twilio, and Webhooks

Here’s how you can build and integrate an AI-powered assistant with Twilio for SMS interactions, API integrations with your PMS, and webhook automation:

import os
from twilio.rest import Client
from google.cloud import dialogflowcx_v3
import json
import requests
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

# Twilio setup
twilio_account_sid = 'your_twilio_account_sid'
twilio_auth_token = 'your_twilio_auth_token'
twilio_phone_number = 'your_twilio_phone_number'
client = Client(twilio_account_sid, twilio_auth_token)

# Dialogflow CX setup
project_id = 'your_project_id'
location = 'global'  # Can be changed based on your setup
agent_id = 'your_agent_id'
session_client = dialogflowcx_v3.SessionsClient()
session_path = session_client.session_path(project_id, location, agent_id, "guest-session")

# Webhook endpoint to handle incoming requests
app = Flask(__name__)

# Function to send message using Twilio
def send_sms(to, body):
    message = client.messages.create(
        body=body,
        from_=twilio_phone_number,
        to=to
    )
    return message.sid

# Function to call Dialogflow CX and get response
def detect_intent_text(text_input, session_id):
    text_input = dialogflowcx_v3.TextInput(text=text_input, language_code="en")
    query_input = dialogflowcx_v3.QueryInput(text=text_input)
    
    request = dialogflowcx_v3.DetectIntentRequest(
        session=session_id, query_input=query_input
    )
    
    response = session_client.detect_intent(request=request)
    return response.query_result.fulfillment_text

# Webhook endpoint to interact with Dialogflow and handle actions
@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    # Extract user input and phone number from incoming request
    data = request.json
    user_message = data.get('message', '')
    user_phone = data.get('phone', '')

    # Send user message to Dialogflow CX
    response_message = detect_intent_text(user_message, session_path)

    # Send response back to user through SMS
    send_sms(user_phone, response_message)

    # If the response is related to review disputes or guest queries, integrate with PMS API
    if 'review dispute' in user_message.lower():
        # Call PMS API for review dispute automation
        response = handle_review_dispute(user_message)
        send_sms(user_phone, response)
    
    return jsonify({"status": "success"}), 200

# Function to handle review disputes (Webhook to PMS)
def handle_review_dispute(user_message):
    # Example: Call the PMS API to track reviews and initiate dispute
    pms_api_url = 'https://your-pms-api-url.com/track-review'
    payload = {
        "message": user_message,
        "action": "dispute"
    }
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}

    # Send data to PMS API
    response = requests.post(pms_api_url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return "Your review dispute has been submitted successfully."
    else:
        return "There was an issue with submitting your dispute. Please try again later."

# Function to initiate Dialogflow CX webhook
def initiate_dialogflow_cx_webhook():
    # Example payload for Dialogflow CX webhook
    payload = {
        "intent": "Manage Guest Inquiry",
        "parameters": {
            "check_in_date": "2023-12-25",
            "guest_name": "John Doe",
            "booking_reference": "XYZ123"
        }
    }
    response = requests.post('https://your-dialogflow-webhook-url.com', json=payload)
    return response.json()

# Starting the Flask app
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)

Step 4: How This Works

    Dialogflow CX Integration:
        We use Dialogflow CX to process user inputs (e.g., guest inquiries or review disputes). The function detect_intent_text sends the user's message to the Dialogflow CX agent and returns the response.
        Dialogflow is configured with intents such as "Manage Guest Inquiry" and "Handle Review Disputes" based on your business needs.

    Twilio SMS Interaction:
        When the user sends an SMS, it is captured by the webhook, which calls Twilio API to send the response back to the user.
        The send_sms function allows the assistant to send SMS replies to users.

    Webhook Integration with PMS:
        If the user queries about review disputes, the webhook triggers an API call to your PMS (e.g., Hostaway or ResNexus) to handle the dispute automatically by integrating with PMS APIs (this is done via handle_review_dispute).

    API Integration and Automation:
        The assistant can also initiate various workflows and send out automated emails or API requests (e.g., disputes or review tracking) by using webhooks and API endpoints.

Step 5: Deployment

    Deploy the Flask app to a cloud service (e.g., Google Cloud Platform, AWS, Heroku) to expose your /webhook endpoint.
    Integrate your Dialogflow CX agent and configure intents for guest management, review disputes, etc.

Step 6: Testing and Enhancement

    Test the virtual assistant by sending different guest queries or review disputes via SMS.
    Continuously enhance the conversation flow in Dialogflow CX based on the interactions.
    Monitor interactions and improve AI performance with custom training phrases and webhook logic.

Conclusion

This setup provides a solid foundation for building and deploying an AI-powered virtual assistant for your Airbnb business. You can automate guest inquiries, review disputes, and integrate seamlessly with PMS systems, enhancing your workflow with minimal human intervention.
